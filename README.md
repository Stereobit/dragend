# How to

```html
<div id="demo">
  <div class="dragend-page"></div>
  <div class="dragend-page"></div>
</div>
```

## with jQuery
```javascript
$("#demo").dragend(options);
```

## without jQuery
```javascript
new Dragend(document.getElementById("demo"), options);
```

## update and jump to page

You can call the dragend method a second time to trigger some actions. When you want to go to a page when you click on a link you could do something like this:

```javascript
$("#container").dragend();

$("#my-link").on("click", function() {
   $("#container").dragend({
    scrollToPage: 2
  });
});
```

instead of scrollToPage you can use jumpToPage to get to a page without a animation. Or

```javascript
$("#container").dragend("left");
```

to swipe left or right.

## destroy

Call the destroy method to unbind the events and reset the styles

```javascript]
var instance =  new Dragend();
instance.destroy();
```

# Options
  * pageClass: classname selector for all elments that should provide a page  
  * direction: "horizontal" or "vertical"
  * minDragDistance: minuimum distance (in pixel) the user has to drag to trigger swip
  * page: Number of page to load on start
  * scribe: pixel value for a possible scribe
  * onSwipeStart: callback function before the animation
  * onSwipeEnd: callback function after the animation
  * onDrag: callback on drag
